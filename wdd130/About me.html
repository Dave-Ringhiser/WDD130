    <h2>David Ringhiser</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone, I am David Ringhiser. I am from Newark, Ohio. My major is Financial Economics, but I have decided to take this course as an elective because it sounded interesting.</p>
    <p>My hobbies include reading, schutzhund, and games. As for what I enjoy reading, The Call of Cthulhu by H.P. Lovecraft is my favorite short story. Schutzhund is a training method for dogs which has become a sport in some circles, but I have taken to it for its methodology which can be used to better train certain breeds of dog. I have a German Shepherd that I named Brigitta, I chose the name from one of the characters in the Sound of Music. As for games, Monopoly is pretty fun.</p>
    <p>I served a mission through the church, I was assigned to the Berlin mission, I have been back for close to five years now. I used to be a German tutor on campus but quit the job when I needed to go back home due to the declining health of some close family members.</p>
    <p>thank you for reading.</p>
